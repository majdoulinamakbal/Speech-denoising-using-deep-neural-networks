# Speech-denoising-using-deep-neural-networks

This project aims to remove noise from a noisy audio file using a fully convolutional neural network .

The model used is inpired by matlab's implementation : 

https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/denoise-speech-using-deep-learning-networks.html

This notebook includes all the steps of the implementation from model training till testing .

Technologies used :

-tensorflow for model training and testing.
-TIMIT_TRAIN and TIMIT_TEST data bases , very diverse speech files : women,men of different pitches .
-Python3.8
-Google Colab for GPU .
